Atticus said to Jem one day, I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.
That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. 
That’s the worst, I think. 
But it’s more than that, isn’t it? 
But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.
People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.
“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.
They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. 
When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.
The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away.
Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. 
And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over.
That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.

And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades.
“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn.
